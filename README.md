📜 Project Description: C++-Based Virtual Machine Emulator

This project is a console-based virtual machine emulator developed in C++, aimed at providing a deep dive into low-level system emulation. Inspired by vintage emulators, this project simulates the operation of a basic CPU architecture, allowing users to run machine instructions and monitor the execution flow of programs.

The tool enables step-by-step debugging, memory analysis, and virtual execution of assembly code, designed for both educational use and system-level debugging. By emulating a simplified CPU architecture, it helps learners and developers better understand how processors handle tasks on a basic, low-level level.

🔧 Key Features ✅ Customizable CPU architecture with registers and flags

✅ Memory manipulation (hex dump and editing)

✅ Assembly code execution and stepping

✅ Real-time register updates during execution

✅ Debugging breakpoints and memory watches

✅ Simple interface for assembly code input and execution

✅ Compatibility with C++ IDEs like CLion and Visual Studio

💡 Use Case:

If you’re a computer science student like Mudassir 💙, a hardware enthusiast, or someone keen on understanding the internal workings of a CPU, this emulator is an excellent tool to explore the intricacies of machine-level operations.
