# MASM_Debugger
Project Description: MASM-Style Debugger in C++
This project is a console-based debugger built in C++, inspired by the traditional DEBUG.EXE utility from DOS environments. Designed for educational purposes and low-level system diagnostics, it provides a hands-on platform to interact with registers, memory, and machine-level instructions, mimicking the core features of MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) debugger.

The tool supports step-by-step execution, instruction tracing, memory inspection/editing, and disassembly, offering deep insight into how programs operate at the hardware-near level on x86 architecture. It can be used as both a learning tool for students and a utility for system-level developers or enthusiasts.

🔧 Key Features
✅ Register view and modification (AX, BX, CX, DX, etc.)

✅ Hexadecimal memory dump and editing

✅ Manual instruction assembly (like MOV AX, 4C00)

✅ Instruction-level tracing (step-by-step)

✅ Code disassembly to human-readable format

✅ File loading and simulated execution

✅ Full compatibility with CLion and Visual Studio

💡 Use Case
Whether you're a software engineering student like Mudassir 💙, a reverse engineer, or just love working close to the metal, this project is a playground to explore how systems really work beneath the surface.
